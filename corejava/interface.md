`Interface` is a way of describing what classes should do , without specifying how they should do it. A class can implement one or more interfaces. You can then use objects of these implementing classes whenever conformance to the interface is required.

## The Interface Concept
In Java, an interface is not a class but a set of requirements for the classes that want to conform to the interface.
